cv_img=cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread("Main.jpeg"),cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

    cv2.imread("Main.jpeg"):

    cv2.imread() is a function from OpenCV used to read an image from a file. In this case, it reads the image file named "Main.jpeg".
    The image is read in the default color format, which is BGR (Blue, Green, Red) for OpenCV.
    cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB:

    This is a color conversion code provided by OpenCV that specifies how to convert an image from BGR color space to RGB color space. BGR and RGB are different ways of representing colors in images. BGR is the default color space used by OpenCV, while RGB is commonly used in other image processing libraries and applications.
    cv2.cvtColor():

    This function is used to convert an image from one color space to another. In this case, it converts the BGR image obtained from cv2.imread() into an RGB image.


photo=PIL.ImageTk.PhotoImage(image=PIL.Image.fromarray(cv_img))

    PIL.Image.fromarray(cv_img):

    PIL.Image.fromarray() is a method from the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which is now maintained under the Pillow library. It creates a PIL image object from a NumPy array (cv_img in this case).
    cv_img is presumably an image loaded and processed using OpenCV (which often uses NumPy arrays to represent images).
    This method converts the NumPy array into a PIL image object, which is a format that can be used with other libraries, such as Tkinter.
    PIL.ImageTk.PhotoImage(image=...):

    PIL.ImageTk.PhotoImage is a class provided by the Pillow library in conjunction with Tkinter. It is used to create an image object that can be used in Tkinter widgets like labels or canvases.
    By passing the PIL image object created in the previous step as the image parameter, this class converts it into a format that Tkinter can handle.
    photo=...:

    This assigns the resulting PhotoImage object to the variable photo. This photo object can now be used with Tkinter widgets to display the image.
